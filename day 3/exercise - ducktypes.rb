# Create different vehicles. A vehicle has a number of
# wheels and makes some noise.
# Create a class that counts the total number of wheels
# of the vehicles inside of a given array and another class
# that prints all the different noises that vehicles in an
# array make.
# You canâ€™t use inheritance.
